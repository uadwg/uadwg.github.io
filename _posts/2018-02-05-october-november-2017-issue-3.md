## Indigenous Peoples’ Day

**by Jerome Allen, TEFL 50**

On an early morning on September 12th, 2017, in New York City, a century-old Christopher Columbus statue, situated in Central Park, was discovered with its hands painted red and the words, “Hate will not be tolerated” spray-painted on its pedestal. This image of a lauded historical figure and evidence of violence fuels the discussion on how Americans should spend their second Monday of October. On one side, there is glorification of a person who catalyzed colonization thus building the steps toward the modern day American continents, and on the other side, there is demand to recognize figure the decimated populations of Native Americans lost through disease, slavery, and bloodshed.

Sponsored by the Spanish monarchs King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to search for gold and spices in August 1492, Christopher Columbus, an Italian-born explorer, began a voyage for China, India, and the islands of Asia. Unaware of the existence of the Atlantic Ocean and the Americas, in October, Columbus sighted Cuba and mistook it for China. Later in December, he mistook Hispaniola (currently known as, Haiti and the Dominican Republic) for Japan. This Caribbean Island became the location of Spain’s first colony in the Americas. In March 1493, Columbus returned to Spain and brought “Indian” captives with him.

The indigenous Taino of the Caribbean islands populated Cuba, Trinidad, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. The Taino population was estimated to be about 250,000 people at the arrival of Columbus. By 1542, due to spread of smallpox, torture, and enslavement, the Taino population dwindled to 200. This is all directly linked to colonization.

Fast-forward to 1937, due to the intense lobbying from both Catholic and Italian organizations, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed Columbus Day a national holiday. Christopher Columbus was both a devout Catholic and a person of Italian descent. This is seen and represented differently throughout Latin and South America. In some Latin countries, it is "Día de la Raza" ("Day of the Race"), in Belize, Día de las Américas (Day of the Americas), in Argentina, Día del Respeto a la Diversidad Cultural (Day of Respect for Cultural Diversity), and in Venezuela, Dìa de la Resistencia Indìgena (“Day of Indigenous Resistance”)

Some Americans are uneasy towards not recognizing the story and experiences of the Taino people and natives throughout the Americas. In an op-ed article, Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado writes to the Daily Emerald of Oregon, “the celebration of Columbus is difficult to balance without overshadowing the Native American side of history. To start off, there is no Native American side of history”. Alvarado reproves Columbus Day for its perpetuation of the erasure of indigenous voices.

In October 2017, from a Columbus Day Parade in Denver, Rita DeFrange, chairwoman of the parade’s organizing committee, told the Denver Post, “There are a whole host of Italians who brought a lot to our country... It’s a culture we hold dear and want to celebrate.” During the late 1800’s, immigration of Italians to the United States was marked with hostility and irascible attitudes. Through a myth spread by American writer Washington Irving, Christopher Columbus became a figure to legitimize the Italian “contribution” to America (by “discovering America”) and a greater symbol of Italian accomplishments.

As of today, several U.S. cities and states have replaced Columbus Day with Indigenous Peoples’ Day, including Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, Denver, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. The conversation on this matter continues today. Some want to shift away from the glorification of Columbus because of how it can impact Native Americans today. This is a focus on building an acute awareness of the struggles and experiences of these people which ultimately, can lead to healing.

Growing up Mexican-American in Southern California was the norm. Being a Mexican-American in Ukraine, however, is truly a unique experience. Because of a lack of interaction with Hispanic cultures and media (minus the songs in Spanish that play on the radio), Ukrainians usually do not know much about Hispanic cultures. When I walk around I get stares of course, but usually these looks are simply out of curiosity. When I have asked Ukrainians how they feel about Hispanics, they usually do not know how to respond as they usually do not know much about Latin America or Spanish culture. However, I found that as soon as I started sharing my culture, through food recipes, movies, music, and more, Ukrainians were ecstatic seeing the similarities both cultures share. My advice to volunteers who are interested in promoting and highlighting Mexican American culture is to integrate this topic into an English Club and making Mexican food is the quickest way to interest Ukrainians on this topic (just make sure it’s not spicy)! 

## Post-Soviet Punk Rock Dialectics in Serhiy Zhadan's Depeche Mode

**by Mia Billetdeaux, TEFL 50**

The rock star poet may feel like a bygone era in the west, but in a post-Soviet country with fluid ideas on intellectual property struggling to assert its own voice, Serhiy Zhadan is just that. A poet, punk singer and activist who started his career in Kharkiv, Zhadan has become the voice for a generation bent on being heard. 

In his debut novel, _Depeche Mode_ , a nihilist pack of friends serpentine through surrealistic 1990s Kharkiv. After a scuffle with the mafia over smuggled vodka sales territory, they set off in search of a missing friend. Through the liquid fog of their failed business venture they peak into an evangelist’s revival, loiter around the luxury flat of a former general’s daughter and eventually find their way to a Pioneers’ summer camp. In its best moments, the novel offers comedic relief in the absurdity and chaos of the period through the eyes of its disillusioned youth.  

Available in English on Amazon. Similar to Chuck Palahniuk, Irvine Welsh and Anthony Burgess.
