### Some Roots Are Deeper Than Others

“BLACK. IS. BEAUTIFUL!” I never fully

understood why my fourth-grade teacher had us chant

this, in our inner-city D.C. elementary school. Being

surrounded by pictures of African-American icons,

expected to complete extensive research projects for

Black History Month, and having participated in

extracurricular activities that both combined soccer

and black poetry, it all seemed normal.
