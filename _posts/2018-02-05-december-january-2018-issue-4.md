## Where School Ends, Church Begins

**by Garret Wolfe, TEFL 50**

Most of us in TEFL have witnessed during the first day of school and other points during the year an Orthodox priest blessing the opening of school-buildings on First Bell, as well throughout the year. For some, this is their first induction into how prominently religion is featured in Ukrainian schools, both in class (Christian ethics class) and outside of class (priest being involved in major school events).

In September of this year Ukraine’s parliament passed a bevy of education reforms, among these reforms was a section that dealt with Church and State. This line (according to Unian) essentially reads that “...state and municipal educational institutions are separated from the church (religious organizations), operate as secular organizations.” What is fascinating is that Section II, Article 35 of the Ukrainian constitution (2004) already reads that “The Church and religious organizations in Ukraine are separated from the State, and the school — from the Church...”

What I believe is important in regards to the recently passed legislation is two-fold. First, it appears that Ukrainian educational reform sees that “church and state” separation is in many cases simply on paper and not practice. Secondly, it has the potential to further promote a secular, inclusive environment for all of Ukraine’s many minority religious groups.
