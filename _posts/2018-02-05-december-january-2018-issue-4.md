### Where School Ends, Church Begins

**by Garret Wolfe, Group 50, TEFL**

Most of us in TEFL have witnessed during the first day of school and other points during the year an Orthodox priest blessing the opening of school-buildings on First Bell, as well throughout the year. For some, this is their first induction into how prominently religion is featured in Ukrainian schools, both in class (Christian ethics class) and outside of class (priest being involved in major school events).

In September of this year Ukraine’s parliament passed a bevy of education reforms, among these reforms was a section that dealt with Church and State. This line (according to Unian) essentially reads that “...state and municipal educational institutions are separated from the church (religious organizations), operate as secular organizations.” What is fascinating is that Section II, Article 35 of the Ukrainian constitution (2004) already reads that “The Church and religious organizations in Ukraine are separated from the State, and the school — from the Church...”

What I believe is important in regards to the recently passed legislation is two-fold. First, it appears that Ukrainian educational reform sees that “church and state” separation is in many cases simply on paper and not practice. Secondly, it has the potential to further promote a secular, inclusive environment for all of Ukraine’s many minority religious groups.

### Bi-ing Time: Coming out Christian

**by Matthew Smith, Group 52, TEFL**

If you want to get asked a lot of personal questions, come out as bi. If you want to get asked a lot of loaded, personal questions, be the son of a pastor and then come out as bi. If you want to get asked a separate set of equally loaded, equally personal questions, come out as Christian in the LGBTQIA+ community. In 2013, the Pew Research Center released a survey saying that 42% of LGBT Americans identified as Christians. I remember reading the write up on this shortly after it was released and feeling so shocked. For me, being bi and in the church had been a profoundly lonely experience.

I grew up as the son of a pastor of one of those churches that gets categorized as Evangelical every election, which means I grew up hearing the ways that other Christians talked about homosexuality. As I went through the beginning stages of coming to terms with my own sexuality, I spent a lot of time ensuring that no one in my church would know. On the other hand, after spending time in the LGBTQIA+ community, I had also heard the ways that other gays talked about Christians and spent a lot of time ensuring that they too would not know me. It was like being in a two-sided closet where I wasn’t welcome on either side.

It was so from this position that I learned want allyship really looked like. I had friends on both sides of this precarious closet who supported me and took on the arguments, that had made it so difficult for me to come out, as their own. The most important thing I learned through this time is that being an ally doesn’t mean you 100% understand the other person or their experience, but that doesn’t matter, because the conversation isn’t about you. It’s about using your privilege to extend the voice of others.

### Jewish in Ukraine

**by Joseph Heller, Group 51, YD**

Child of the 1990 Tuareg Rebellion, Niger’s Omara “Bombino” Moctar is a world-renowned guitarist who addresses his country’s geopolitical concerns through intricate rock and blues composition in the Tuareg language of Tamasheq. In his work, specifically his 2016 album Azel, he commonly ties religious tradition to contemporary musical elements. Within Niger, his music has been seen as a mark of peace, a triumphant irony following the 2007 Tuareg Rebellion. The music of Tuareg was banned from Niger, yet Bombino continues to use his international platform to speak frankly about the Taureg culture and tradition.
